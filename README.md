# Ferashia Engine

**Ferashia is an open-source, Rust game engine simply built for DirectX 12 Ultimate, implementing its latest features into a clean suite of tools that developers can use to create their own games.** It aims to create beautiful worlds with high graphical fidelity, with exporting avaliable to Windows clients.

## Free, open source and community-driven

Ferashia is completely free and open source. Users' games are theirs, down to the engine code that runs their games. Contributing is well appreciated.

## Notes

The aim for Ferashia is to create a working, well-defined engine based on the DirectX 12 Ultimate API. It's soley a personal project to understand how game engines work. I do not have future plans for developing anything on the engine, as it is a side-project from my highschool studies.
